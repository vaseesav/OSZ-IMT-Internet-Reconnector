# Automatic WiFi Reconnector

This is a Python script that automatically reconnects to the OSZ IMT School WiFi network after you have used up your 1GB quota. The script automates the process, making it faster and more convenient.

# Requirements

To install the dependencies for this script, you need to run the following command:

``pip install selenium``

# Usage

To run the script, you need to open a console window and navigate to the project directory. Then, enter the following command:

``python main.py -l username:password``

For Windows users, the command should be

``main.py -l username:password``

Replace username and password with your school's WiFi credentials.
